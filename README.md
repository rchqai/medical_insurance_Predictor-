🚀 About the Project:
This is an AI-powered FastAPI-based application that predicts medical insurance costs 💸 based on user details like age, BMI, smoking status, and region. The model helps users estimate their insurance expenses using machine learning 📊.

✨ Features

✅ Fast & Accurate Predictions ⚡
✅ Built with FastAPI & XGBoost 🏗️
✅ REST API for easy integration 🔗
✅ One-click Deployment on cloud ☁️
✅ Dockerized for scalability 🐳


🔢 How It Works?

1️⃣ Input Details (age, BMI, children, smoker status, region, etc.)
2️⃣ ML Model Analyzes Data 🤖
3️⃣ Predicts Insurance Cost 💵
4️⃣ Returns Estimated Cost in JSON Format 📩


🔧 Tech Stack

🟢 FastAPI - High-performance API framework
📊 Pandas & NumPy - Data processing
📈 XGBoost - Machine Learning Model
🐳 Docker - Containerization
☁️ Render - Cloud Deployment

🚀 API Usage

📌 Base URL: http://localhost:9000 (or Deployed URL)

🔹 Test if API is Working:  curl http://localhost:9000
Response: {"message": "API is working!"}

🔹 Make a Prediction: curl -X POST "http://localhost:9000/predict" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{
  "age": 30,
  "bmi": 25.3,
  "children": 1,
  "sex": "male",
  "smoker": "no",
  "region": "southeast"
}'

Response: {"predicted_cost": 4500.75}
